<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is **Sivasakthi M**, and I’m a recent MCA graduate from KIT – Kalaignar Karunanidhi Institute of Technology, Coimbatore. I’m passionate about building user-friendly, responsive, and scalable web applications, and I’m currently seeking a role as a Full Stack Web Developer.
  During my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I’ve worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React for the front end, and on the back end, I have experience with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
  I’ve also used Git and GitHub for version control and have built a few personal projects that demonstrate my skills in creating full-stack web applications.As a fresher, I bring a strong willingness to learn, adapt quickly to new technologies, and contribute effectively to a team. I’m looking for an opportunity where I can grow as a developer while adding value to real-world projects.
  Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself. I’m excited to begin my career in web development and contribute meaningfully to your team.</p>
